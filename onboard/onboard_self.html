                  <p>As a travel enthusiast, I've been to a lot of places and taken a ton of flights. But no matter how many times I fly, I always feel a little stressed on the day of travel, even if I'm super prepared. This is what inspired me to create a product that can help to reduce the stress experienced by the travelers on the day of their flight.</p>
